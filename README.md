# StrobeLight
Strobe Light Swift version for iOS apps used to produce the regular flashes of light. A Strobe light turns phone camera on &amp; off to produces very short, intense flashes of light by means of an electric discharge in a gas. The ability of strobe lights to "freeze" the motion of rapidly moving objects makes them very useful.
